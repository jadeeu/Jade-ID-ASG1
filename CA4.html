                        Chase Atlantic is an Australian alternative R&B band formed in 2014 by members Christian Anthony and brothers Mitchel and Clinton Cave. Initially forming in 2011 as a university project, they gained early attention with their 2014 EP *Dalliance* and the 2015 viral single “Friends”. They are known for their "dark alternative pop" sound, and their career includes signing with the Maddens' management company, releasing multiple EPs and albums, and gaining international recognition.

                        According to Mitchel, the name “Chase Atlantic” means nothing — it was simply a combination of two words the band liked: Chase and Atlantic. “We spent a couple of minutes trying to come up with a plausible and profound explanation for the band name. [Chase Atlantic] literally means nothing,” says Cave.
